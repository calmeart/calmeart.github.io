## About Site

This page is designed to be a front-page for my development career. It will showcase a summary of a description of me and what I am working on lately. And it will develop and blossom as time goes by.

## Future Implementations

This page in its current version is a one-page website that includes minimum information that allows me to present myself to an exterior opinion.

### In future versions:

* About will navigate to a more detailed page with a picture of me, more information about who I am, what is my journey, and my hobbies.
* It will redirect to a blog site people could follow my journey of changing career to become a web developer.
* Projects will navigate to a different page that not only show six but show all my projects that can be sorted, filtered, and categorized by technology, date, importance, etc.
